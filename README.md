# Scalable k-means++

This repository contains the deliverables for Zachary Nawrocki, and Ziping Song's pedagogical course project in CSCI 4961, Randomized Algorithms for Machine Learning and Optimization at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. <br>

The topic we selected was Scalable k-means++, based on the following paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.6402.pdf
